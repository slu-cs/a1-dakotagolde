            <h2>St. Lawrence County Board of Elections</h2>
            <p>The SLC Board of Elections is a bi-partisan Board representative of the two major political parties as determined by the most recent Gubernatorial election.
The Board is responsible for the implementation of State Election Law and the administration of elections in St. Lawrence County.  In doing so, they are entrusted to ensure that each qualified voter has the opportunity to exercise his or her elective franchise, as well as to protect the integrity of the entire election process.
St. Lawrence County maintains voter registration data for approximately 60,000 active voters.  For election purposes, the County's 32 Towns and City of Ogdensburg are further divided into "election districts."  These election districts are determined by each municipality, based on its number of registered voters.  Currently, there are a total of 81 election districts throughout the county.</p>
