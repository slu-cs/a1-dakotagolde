Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.
    - I can't find any deadlines for absentee voting in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - The footer doesn't really seem necessary since the address already appears elsewhere.
    - Hours could arguably be better presented in a table.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The links to voter registration forms are styled differently than the other links.
    - On the Board Members page, the right-side column doesn't align neatly.
